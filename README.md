# hello-world
Initial repository for the codecademy class on HTML, CSS - this should house the Damato's project.

This is the first time using Github, and this is the readme-edits branch. 
This project is to showcase what I've learned in completing the HTML and CSS portions of the coadecademy class "Build Websites From Scratch".
This project contains the work for Damato's website - a quick project for HTML with linked CSS file.
